      "#Classifying States in Cygnus X-1\n",
      "\n",
      "Aims:\n",
      "- Unsupervised classification of Cygnus X-1 states based on pointed observations (usually derived from parameters by hand)\n",
      "- How many distinct states are there (i.e. does the intermediate state exist)?\n",
      "- Do the hard and soft states change with time: do they look the same over the entire lifetime of the observations?\n",
      "- which features decide on whether a source is in a soft, intermediate or hard state?\n",
      "- should we use the clean biweekly sample or can we use the earlier data taken in a different mode?\n",
      "\n",
      "We might need to refine these questions as we go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data we have are:\n",
      "- data are satellite orbit by satellite orbit, average exposure 1.6-1.7 ks\n",
      "- 2015 individual observations, each of which make a single sample (feature vector)\n",
      "- data consist of:\n",
      "    - light curves\n",
      "    - spectral fits\n",
      "    - hardnesses if necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "Need to decide:\n",
      "- which features to include\n",
      "- whether to include spectral fit parameters\n",
      "- whether to include radio emission\n",
      "- do feature engineering, throw out features that don't add anything, run unsupervised classification on restricted feature set, but check back with full feature set whether the unsupervised classification changes significantly!\n",
